In a **personal loan calculator**, the amount you can borrow is usually based on the **loan principal**, **interest rate**, and the **loan term**. The difference between a standard **personal loan** and the way you're calculating withdrawals based on monthly payments (as in the code you've provided) comes down to how the **interest** is applied and the structure of the repayment.

### Key Differences Between Your Loan Calculator and a Personal Loan Calculator:

1. **Structure of Payments**:
   - In a **personal loan**, the borrower typically receives a lump sum amount upfront (the loan principal), and then makes fixed monthly payments (which include both interest and principal repayment) over the loan term.
   - In your case, the amount you're calculating (the withdrawal) is based on **how much monthly payment you're willing to make** over a certain number of months, and the **effective interest rate** is applied to calculate the maximum loan (present value) you can withdraw upfront.

2. **Interest Calculation**:
   - In a **personal loan**, the interest is typically calculated based on the outstanding loan balance at any point in time. The total loan amount doesn't change, but the portion of each payment going toward interest decreases over time as the loan balance decreases.
   - In your case, the **Effective Interest Rate (EIR)** is applied to the monthly payments to determine how much **you can borrow today**, considering the total payments you plan to make over the loan period.

3. **Present Value vs. Loan Principal**:
   - In a **personal loan**, you receive a fixed **loan principal** upfront, and you repay that principal (plus interest) over time.
   - In your calculator, the present value (withdrawal amount) is calculated based on the future stream of monthly payments, adjusted for the interest rate over the loan term. This means you're figuring out the maximum amount you can borrow **today** given your monthly payment plan.

4. **Interest Types**:
   - **Personal Loans** typically use **simple interest** or **amortized interest**, where interest is calculated on the declining balance.
   - Your calculation uses **compounded interest**, where the interest is compounded monthly (using the **Effective Interest Rate**), which more accurately reflects the true cost of borrowing when there are regular, recurring payments.

### Breakdown of Your Code vs. Personal Loan Calculator:

1. **In Your Code**:
   - You are calculating how much money can be borrowed today based on the amount of **fixed monthly payments** and an **Effective Interest Rate (EIR)**.
   - The formula for calculating the **present value** of a loan is:
     \[
     PV = P \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( P \) is the monthly payment.
     - \( r \) is the monthly interest rate derived from the **Effective Interest Rate**.
     - \( n \) is the total number of months.

2. **In a Standard Personal Loan**:
   - The loan principal is given upfront, and the monthly payments (which include interest and principal repayment) are made to pay back the loan over time.
   - The interest is typically **amortized**, meaning the monthly payments stay fixed, but the portion of each payment going toward interest decreases over time, while the portion going toward the principal increases.

#### Example: Personal Loan Calculation

If you take a personal loan for ₹100,000 with a **Nominal Interest Rate** of 14% annually for a **term of 21 months**, your monthly payments would be calculated as follows:

- Monthly Interest Rate:
  \[
  r_{\text{monthly}} = \frac{14}{100} \div 12 = 0.01167 \text{ (or 1.167% per month)}
  \]

- Using the **loan amortization formula** for fixed monthly payments:
  \[
  M = P \times \frac{r_{\text{monthly}} \times (1 + r_{\text{monthly}})^n}{(1 + r_{\text{monthly}})^n - 1}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( M \) is the monthly payment.
  - \( P \) is the principal loan amount.
  - \( r_{\text{monthly}} \) is the monthly interest rate.
  - \( n \) is the number of months (loan term).

For a ₹100,000 loan, the **monthly payment** would be around ₹5,509 over 21 months.

### How Interest is Applied in Your Case:
In your current loan withdrawal calculation, the **Effective Interest Rate** determines how much you can borrow today based on **fixed monthly payments** over time. The **compounding** makes the interest add up over time, which reduces the amount you can borrow compared to the total payments you'll make over time.

### Example:
Let's walk through the calculation for your inputs:

1. **Monthly Payment**: ₹10,000
2. **Total Months**: 21
3. **Effective Interest Rate (EIR)**: 14% annually.

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Monthly Interest Rate**: Convert the **Effective Annual Interest Rate** to a monthly rate:
   \[
   r_{\text{monthly}} = (1 + \frac{14}{100})^{1/12} - 1 \approx 0.010975
   \]

2. **Present Value (Loan Amount)**: Use the **present value of an annuity** formula to calculate how much you can withdraw (loan amount):
   \[
   PV = 10,000 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.010975)^{-21}}{0.010975} = 391,686.22
   \]
   
   This means that based on a **monthly payment** of ₹10,000 for 21 months at a **14% effective interest rate**, the total loan amount you can withdraw today is **₹391,686.22**.

---

### Conclusion:

- **In a personal loan**, you receive a fixed **loan principal** upfront and repay that with **fixed monthly payments** (including interest and principal repayment).
- **In your case**, you're calculating how much you can borrow today (the present value) based on fixed **monthly payments** and the **Effective Interest Rate** applied over the loan period. This approach is more focused on deriving the maximum withdrawal based on future payments, rather than how much you owe on a principal loan.
